## Week 2
### Landing page recreation
This week's problem consists of creating an HTML document that has the same content as the Landing Page of the screenflow made previously, using the desktop version, and adding all the content (title, subtitles, date, text, images, links, etc.) regarding the semantic elements of HTML and saving the progress in a public Github repository.

## Week 3
### Adding styles for the Landing Page

## Week 7
### JavaScript Async y Storage
In this problem we continue to work on what we developed in the previous one.
In each form (login and sign up) we must make an HTTP request using the Javascript Fetch method, sending all the data loaded in the form. In the registration form we must save all the information written in the form in the browser using "localStorage" so that when reloading the site the data is automatically loaded in the form
