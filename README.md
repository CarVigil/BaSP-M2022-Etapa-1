## Week 1
### Landing page recreation
This week's problem consists of creating an HTML document that has the same content as the Landing Page of the screenflow made previously, using the desktop version, and adding all the content (title, subtitles, date, text, images, links, etc.) regarding the semantic elements of HTML and saving the progress in a public Github repository.
